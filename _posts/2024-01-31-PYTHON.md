Once upon a time, in a land far away, there was a programmer named Leo. Leo loved to write code in Python and wanted to share a sorting example with the world.

## Sorting Example

Here is a simple example of sorting a list of numbers in Python:

```python

# Sorting and merging two arrays
array1 = [4, 2, 6, 1]
array2 = [3, 5, 7, 9]

sorted_array1 = sorted(array1)
sorted_array2 = sorted(array2)

merged_array = sorted_array1 + sorted_array2

print(merged_array)


```
