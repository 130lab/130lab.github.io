# YOLO

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection system. It is a popular algorithm in computer vision that can detect objects in images and videos with remarkable accuracy and speed.

## Introduction

YOLO revolutionized the field of object detection by introducing a single neural network architecture that can directly predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for multiple objects in a single pass. This approach eliminates the need for complex region proposal networks and significantly speeds up the detection process.

## Example Usage

To demonstrate the usage of YOLO for object detection, let's consider an example where we want to detect objects in a visual image. Here's how you can use YOLO in Python:

```python
